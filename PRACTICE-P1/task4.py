UNIT 3 PRACTICE - Task 4: Build Custom Playlist
=============================================================================
Concepts: **kwargs, try/except, dictionary building, summing values

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Complete the function below where it says # TODO
2. Run this file to test your solution
3. All 4 tests should pass to complete the practice!

def build_playlist(playlist_name, **songs):
    """
    Build a custom playlist from keyword arguments.
    
    Creates a playlist dictionary with the playlist name, a dictionary
    of songs with their play counts, and the total number of plays.
    Uses try/except to safely calculate the total.
    
    Args:
        playlist_name: The name of the playlist (required, string)
        **songs: Any number of song=play_count pairs
                 Example: song1=5, song2=10
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with keys:
              - "name": the playlist name
              - "songs": dictionary of {song: play_count}
              - "total_plays": sum of all play counts
    
    Examples:
        >>> build_playlist("Road Trip", song1=5, song2=10, song3=3)
        {"name": "Road Trip", "songs": {"song1": 5, "song2": 10, "song3": 3}, "total_plays": 18}
        
        >>> build_playlist("Chill Vibes", relaxing=20, ambient=15)
        {"name": "Chill Vibes", "songs": {"relaxing": 20, "ambient": 15}, "total_plays": 35}
        
        >>> build_playlist("Empty Playlist")
        {"name": "Empty Playlist", "songs": {}, "total_plays": 0}
    """
    # TODO: Write your code here (replace 'pass')
    # Hint 1: **songs is already a dictionary!
    # Hint 2: Use sum(songs.values()) to get total plays
    # Hint 3: Wrap the sum in try/except in case of bad values
    # Hint 4: Return a dictionary with "name", "songs", and "total_plays"
    try:
        total_plays = sum(songs.values())
